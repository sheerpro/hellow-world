ABSTRACT
Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of large-scale microservice systems, manual troubleshooting is time-consuming and impractical. Therefore, automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is essential. However, existing RCA approaches face significant challenges.
(1) Multi-modal data (e.g. traces, logs, and metrics) record the status
of microservice systems, but most existing RCA approaches rely
on single-source data, failing to understand the system fully. (2)
Existing RCA approaches ignore the services’ anomaly state and
their anomaly intensity. (3) The service-level RCAs lack detailed
information for quick issue resolution. To tackle these challenges,
we propose MRCA, a metric-level RCA approach using multi-modal
data. Our key insight is that using multi-modal data allows for a
comprehensive understanding of the system, enabling the localization of root causes across more anomaly scenarios. MRCA first
utilizes traces and logs to obtain the ranking list of abnormal services based on reconstruction probability. It further builds causal
graphs from services with high anomaly probability to discover
the order in which abnormal metrics of different services occur.
By incorporating a reward mechanism, MRCA terminates the excessive expansion of the causal graph and significantly reduces
the time taken for causal analysis. Finally, MRCA can prune the
ranking list based on the causal graph and identify metric-level root
causes. Experiments on two widely-used microservice benchmarks
demonstrate that MRCA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

1 INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, microservice systems have become the first choice for
large-scale system design [8, 29]. Microservice architecture decomposes complex application systems into multiple small-scale,
autonomous service units [40]. This architecture enhances system
flexibility and scalability, enabling quick adaptation to business
needs and automatic adjustment of service scale for optimal performance and availability [4, 34]. As systems and user demands
grow in complexity and diversity, manual root cause analysis (RCA)
becomes a challenging and time-consuming task [54]. Delays in addressing these failures can significantly impact user experience and
lead to substantial economic losses [12]. Hence, there is a critical
need to explore automated algorithms capable of quickly identifying the root causes to mitigate such risks effectively [7].
The demand for RCA automation generated tremendous academic research [38]. These methods are based on runtime data,
including logs, traces, and performance metrics such as CPU usage,
network received bytes, and response latency. Metric-based RCA
usually involves directly analyzing correlations (e.g. Pearson correlation coefficient) between services, or constructing causal graphs to
pinpoint the root cause [6, 19, 23]. For instance, the 𝜖-Diagnosis [36]
uses 𝜖-statistics to identify key metrics causing small-window longtail latency in web services. Wang et al. proposed Cloudranger [42]
that utilizes metrics to perform dynamic causality analysis without
presetting topology and identify critical services that cause failures.
For trace-based RCA, the process starts by using the fluctuations of
latency in traces to detect anomalies. Once anomalies are identified,
calling information in traces is then used to construct dependency

graphs between services, which help in accurately locating the root
cause [11, 45, 47]. Ding et al. proposed TraceDiag [9] which uses
traces for constructing service dependency graph and optimizes
pruning strategies through reinforcement learning. Additionally,
Anunay Amar et al. proposes LogFaultFlagger [2], which excludes
lines from the log that pass the test, more precisely locating the
faulty. However, log-based methods are relatively rare because the
lack of structure and context of logs make it difficult to locate the
root cause alone.
Although there have been significant recent advances in RCA,
current methods still face limitations as follows:
(1) Insufficient exploitation on multi-modal data: These methods [35] rely on data from single modality, thus failing to capture
the complex relationships between different exception patterns,
ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. Table 1 demonstrates
anomaly information discovered in multi-modal data. We observe
that none of the data modalities can fully cover the five types of
faults that commonly occur in microservices systems. For example,
the log cannot reflect network congestion and CPU contention. Besides, some methods that utilize multi-modal data also have many
limitations. For example, Eadro [22] cannot handle program logic
bugs. Nezha [46] relies on pattern mining, which is time-consuming.
These methods show significant limitations in detection capabilities
and efficiency.
(2) Current RCA methods overlook the importance of anomaly
detection: The accuracy of anomaly detection is crucial for the
overall RCA algorithm, as subsequent localization steps are initiated
only after anomalies are detected. Current methods divide anomaly
detection and localization into two independent stages. And the root
cause localization phase relies on the results of anomaly detection.
Inaccurate anomaly detection will cause some false alarms and
reduce the accuracy of the whole process. However, the anomaly
detection modules of current RCA methods commonly use too
simple techniques such as N-sigma [3], where the data utilized
by RCA are not even normally distributed. These methods mostly
rely on single-modal data and ignore the relationship between
data. In addition, customized anomaly detection methods such as
MicroHECL [26] may restrict the model’s generalization ability and
may not be effective in identifying new anomalies.
(3) Coarse-grained root cause localization at the service level: Most
existing RCA methods provide service-level results, such as MicroScope [25] and MicroRCA [44], which lack sufficient detailed information. This means that Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) cannot
deeply understand the pattern of fault to prevent it from happening
again. Therefore, automatically locating and determining the types
of anomalies (e.g. resource depletion or network disconnections etc.)
is helpful for assisting SREs in rapidly resolving faults. However,
the existing metric-level RCA approaches are usually implemented
by complex causal analysis which needs to establish causal graphs
for each metric, making the response speed of RCA not fast enough.
Especially in large systems, delays in resolving faults can result in
severe financial losses.
To address the above limitations, we propose MRCA, a highly
efficient root cause analysis approach that leverages reinforcement
learning to dynamically terminate causal analysis for microservices.
The core ideas are as follows: 1) By effectively harnessing the valuable information within multi-modal data, we can achieve more accurate root cause localization. 2) Reinforcement learning techniques
are employed to terminate the causal analysis process dynamically,
significantly reducing time consumption. As system data becomes
increasingly diverse, the difficulty of accurately implementing RCA
has also increased. Therefore, it drives us to utilize multi-modal
data, which provides more comprehensive and in-depth insights
from various dimensions.
In detail, MRCA consists of three components: (1) Feature learning incorporates extracting log templates and the trace latency. For
traces, we focus on the latency generated by each service call, considering it as a feature of the called services. For logs, we utilize a
widely used log parser to model log event occurrences. (2) In anomaly detection phase, we use the time-series data processed above
and employ the variational autoencoder (VAE) [20] to calculate the
difference between normal and abnormal modes, thus minimizing
the impact of incorrect detection on the root cause localization process. We obtain an initial rank list, which refers to reconstruction
probability. (3) Root causes localization applies causal analysis to
troubleshoot. In addition, Q-learning is employed to appropriately
stop the expansion of the causal graph, thus avoiding time waste
and balancing accuracy with speed.
We conducted extensive experiments using data collected from
two widely-used microservice benchmarks (i.e. OnlineBoutique [13]
and TrainTicket [10]). For anomaly detection, MRCA significantly
surpasses other baseline approaches, increasing the 𝐹 1 score by
56.4% ∼ 115.7%. For root causes analysis, MRCA achieves high
top-3 accuracy (81.3%) on average and outperforms all compared
approaches by a large margin (25.0% ∼ 117.5%). A series of comprehensive ablation experiments further confirm the contributions of
incorporating multi-modal data and reinforcement learning.
In summary, our work has the following contributions.
• We identified three limitations of existing RCA methods, which
motivates us to explore the application of multi-modal data and
an efficient RCA method by employing reinforcement learning.
• We propose MRCA, a fine-grained method that provides root
causes at the metric level, which offers an efficient solution for
SREs to rapidly resolve anomalies in large-scale microservice
systems.
• MRCA significantly enhances the model’s speed by employing
filtering at the anomaly detection stage and incorporating reinforcement learning algorithms, thereby enabling timely feedback
to facilitate system recovery.
• We conduct experiments on two widely used benchmarks to
evaluate MRCA and show that MRCA identifies the root cause at
the metric level with the best accuracy and efficiency compared
to other baseline methods.
2 MOTIVATION
Motivation 1: Existing RCA methods insufficiently exploit
multi-modal data, resulting in fewer anomaly types they can
cover. Existing RCA methods predominantly use single-source data
due to the high complexity of integrating and processing multimodal data. However, they cannot comprehensively understand
complex microservice systems because different anomalies manifest

in different data dimensions, each capturing distinct information
shown in Table 1. Traces record the propagation path and time
span of requests within the system, logs capture events and state
information during system operation, and metrics quantify system
performance and resource usage. Therefore, we prepare to integrate
diverse data (traces, logs, and metrics), we can capture the full
spectrum of system behavior, leading to more accurate and efficient
detection and resolution of issues.
Motivation 2: Coarse-grained root cause localization at the
service level that increases the time consumption of SREs
resolving anomalies. Some existing methods utilize multi-modal
data, but they provide root causes at a coarse granularity, limited
to the service level [9, 22]. However, in the service-level, engineers
need to spend more time and resources to troubleshoot. In addition,
this coarse-grained positioning results in poor warning effects,
which affects system reliability and availability, thereby affecting
user experience.
Therefore, more fine-grained results (such as metric-level results) are required to assist SREs in resolving anomalies rapidly. For
example, if we accurately locate the memory usage metric of one
service, SREs can determine whether the problem is caused by a
memory leak and take more precise interventions, such as adjusting memory management strategies or optimizing code. Therefore,
metric-level positioning can improve the accuracy of problem diagnosis and repair efficiency, restore normal operation of the system
faster, and reduce downtime and resource waste. Additionally, incorporating causal analysis of inter-service metrics increases the
complexity and duration of the process. Therefore, we integrated
the Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically
terminate the causal analysis, achieving fine-grained and relatively
efficient model.
Motivation 3: Both normal and abnormal services are fed
into the RCA, resulting in the inaccuracy and high complexity of the localization phase. To the best of our knowledge, previous RCA approaches for microservice systems follow the workflow:
1) Anomaly detection is applied. 2) If an alarm is triggered, then
all services are inspected in root cause location phase. However,
these RCA algorithms ignore the services’ anomaly state and their
anomaly intensity. Moreover, normal service will misleading cause
location and waste computation resource. Additionally, without a
preliminary ranking of anomalies, all detected anomalies are treated
equally, which results in low efficiency of RCA. Therefore, we inspect the abnormal services only during the anomaly detection
phase to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of subsequent root
cause localization.
3 PRELIMINARIES & PROBLEM STATEMENT
3.1 PRELIMINARIES
Multi-modal data. In microservice systems, multi-modal monitoring data plays an essential role in maintaining the system’s stability
and reliability [51]. Metric data monitors system health and performance by collecting and analyzing system-level and service-level
metrics, helping to identify and address anomalies. Log data records
detailed event information including timestamps, severity levels,
messages, and contextual details, aiding in the rapid identification
and resolution of issues [48]. Trace data uses unique identifiers for
each service request and its spans, capturing the duration and calling relationships of requests across microservices, helping to detect
and analyze abnormal service behavior [21]. These three types of
data are considered multi-modal data because metric, log and trace
represent numerical data, text data and distributed tracing data respectively [5]. The combination of metrics, logs, and traces provides
a comprehensive view of system behavior, enhancing the accuracy
and efficiency of problem detection and resolution in microservice
systems.
Reinforcement learning (RL). RL is a machine learning method
where an agent interacts continuously with its environment, learning to take optimal actions to maximize cumulative rewards [24].
The agent adjusts its strategy based on reward feedback in each
state, thereby gradually optimizing its decision-making process [55].
We can incorporate different levels of requirements (such as time
consumption, accuracy) into the reward components, enabling the
model to balance time and accuracy. Moreover, the reinforcement
learning approach possesses several advantages, making it suitable
for RCA, which are as follows:
• Adaptability: RL learns universal policies, making it well-suited
for the complex and variable structures of microservice systems [41, 50]. This adaptability enhances RCA algorithms’ effectiveness in diverse environments.
• Few prior knowledge required: RL improves decision-making
through trial-and-error interactions, requiring little prior knowledge [18, 37]. There is a lack of extensive public datasets that
contain multi-modal data. Therefore, incorporating RL can improve RCA by using existing limited data more effectively.
• Optimize complex strategies: RL dynamically integrates multiple variables to optimize decision-making. This helps RCA
analyze numerous metrics more effectively, leading to better
termination strategies.

3.2 Problem Statement
Consider a large system with K microservices, where each service
independently generates system logs, trace data, and metric data.
Within an observation window of length 𝑇 , for the 𝑘-th microservice, we define the multi-source data as X = {(X
L
𝑘
, X
T
𝑘
, XM
𝑘
)}K
𝑘=1
,
where X
L
𝑘
represents log events ordered by time, X
T
𝑘
includes trace
records, and XM
𝑘
represents time series of multiple metrics. Our
algorithm mainly consists of two stages: when X[1:K ] is available,
the system uses log and trace data for anomaly detection. Upon
detecting an anomaly, the system obtains an initial ranking list
List𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 = {X𝑚, X𝑛, ...} based on ascending reconstruction probability denoted by P = [𝑝𝑚, 𝑝𝑛, ...] ∈ [0, 1]
K and initiates subsequent
steps. In root cause localization, we apply the causal analysis to
get the final ranking list List𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 = {(X𝑖
, Y𝑎), (X𝑗
, Y𝑏
), ...} where
Y𝑎, Y𝑏 mean the type of anomalies. The entire process is built on a
parameterized model F : X → List𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 .
4 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we first present the overall workflow of MRCA.
Then we explain each step in detail, including feature extraction,
using VAE for anomaly detection, causal graphs construction via
Granger [14] algorithm, learning termination strategy via Q-learning,
and pruning rule.
4.1 Overview
The overall workflow of MRCA is illustrated in Figure 1. MRCA
consists of three phases: multi-modal data feature learning, anomaly
detection and root causes localization.
We briefly introduce these three phases. Feature learning incorporates extracting log templates and the latency information
contained in traces. For traces, we primarily focus on the latency
generated by various service calls, treating latency as one of the
characteristics of the called services. For logs, we adopt a stateof-the-art log parsing approach Drain [16] to extract static log
templates for each service and then count the frequency of these
templates. These features are aggregated according to timestamps
to obtain unified time-series data. VAE model is trained offline using aggregated data collected during fault-free periods to learn the
normal pattern of the system. In anomaly detection phase, we
use the time-series data processed in the feature learning phase and
employ the trained VAE to distinguish between normal and abnormal modes. An anomaly alert is triggered when the time-series data
significantly deviates from the normal pattern. This deviation is
indicated by a sharp drop in reconstruction probability. Abnormal
services are also ranked based on the reconstruction probability.
Our anomaly detection model not only provides more accurate
alarms but also selects services with higher anomaly score as input
for the next stage, reducing the complexity and time of subsequent
analysis. Root cause localization conducts causal analysis based
on metric data, which constructs and prunes a causal graph to identify the root causes of anomalies at the metric level. Additionally,
Q-learning is employed to appropriately halt the expansion of the
causal graph, preventing time waste and balancing accuracy with
speed.
4.2 Multi-modal Data Feature Extraction
This phase aims to extract key features from the multi-modal monitoring data (i.e. logs and traces). In this part, the input is time series
data {(X
L
𝑘
, X
T
𝑘
)}K
𝑘=1
, the output is For trace learning, the latency of
traces effectively reflects the performance characteristic of the operation, specifically indicating the time taken to complete a request.
So we choose latency as the feature of the called service. Specifically, we process all traces over a given time period to extract the
latency of all calls and construct time-series data. We use a 5s time
window, averaging the duration of all calls within time window to
obtain the latency value for each sample. According to previous
studies[1, 52], the types of logs generated by systems differ between
normal and abnormal states. Therefore, our insight is to extract
templates and determine the anomaly degree of service based on
log frequency fluctuation. For log learning, we use a widely-used
log parser Drain [16] to extract the static log templates of each service, and then count the frequency of occurrence of these templates.
Then these features will be aggregated into a whole according to
the timestamp. The extraction of these two types of features not
only helps us understand the operating mode of different services.
And it provides the model with the necessary data basis to analyze
the deviation of features.
The process of feature fusion can be outlined as follows: Each
service within the system is characterized by a set of 𝑚 Template
features along with a single Latency feature. These features are
combined or fused over a period of time based on time series. After
the above process, we can get the characteristic time series data
F = {F𝑘
}
K
𝑘=1
. A critical assumption in this process is the selection of a time window size denoted as 𝑛, which implies that each
individual feature is represented by 𝑛 dimensions of data. This approach facilitates the integration and analysis of multiple features
across the specified time intervals, contributing to a comprehensive
understanding of system behavior and performance.
4.3 Anomaly Detection
During the anomaly detection process, by analyzing log and trace
data, the model can generate anomaly alerts and calculate anomaly
scores. The scores can help us evaluate the abnormality of the
service and sort the services according to the abnormality level. This
process is based on the reconstruction probability of Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to quantitatively analyze the difference in log
frequency and tracking delay between normal and abnormal states.
VAE consists of two parts: encoder and decoder. The encoder
maps input data to a latent space distribution (usually Gaussian),
while the decoder maps latent space points back to the original
data. We use the logs and traces of the historical data when the
system is running normally to train the VAE model to obtain the
variance and mean. Then input the data in the online stage into
the VAE to calculate the reconstruction error. The algorithm in this
paper obtains the anomaly score by calculating the reconstruction
probability. Because it is more interpretable and takes into account
the uncertainty between differences. The formula for calculating
the reconstruction probability is as follows:
𝑝(𝑥 |𝑧) = N (𝑥; 𝜇(𝑥), 𝜎2

In this formulation, 𝑥 represents the input and 𝑧 stands for latent

First, we use the F = {F𝑘
}
K
𝑘=1
when the system is running normally according to the time window size 𝑇 . These data are input
into the VAE model to train it. Thus VAE is able to reconstruct the
normal data with high accuracy. When an anomaly occurs, there are
significant changes in the data distribution. Once an abnormality
occurs, due to the difference between abnormal data and normal
data, it is difficult for VAE to reconstruct abnormal data, which
means the reconstruction probability decreases significantly. We
need to set a threshold 𝜖 for the reconstruction probability. When
the reconstruction probability of any service is lower than this
threshold, the system will generate an anomaly alert and initiate
subsequent processing steps.
After receiving the anomaly alert, the next step is to obtain the
reconstruction probabilities of different services, the abnormal services can be ranked. The lower the reconstruction probability, the
higher the anomaly score. Meanwhile, we can incorporate an attention mechanism to enhance the specific pattern recognition ability
of the VAE model. For example, when an anomaly occurs, the model
can pay special attention to those log templates that never appear in
normal mode, or those log templates that usually appear frequently
in normal mode but suddenly reduce significantly in frequency.
Such improvements enable VAE to more effectively identify and
respond to abnormal situations. Besides, we will remove the normal service from the list which has a reconstruction probability
higher than 𝜉. After the above processing, we get a ranking list
List𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 = {X𝑚, X𝑛, ...}.
4.4 Root Causes Localization
4.4.1 Causal Graphs Construction via Granger Algorithm. Causal
learning aims to uncover causal relationships through data analysis,
enhancing our understanding of phenomena. It extracts key patterns to identify decisive factors. Despite challenges like high costs
and biases, recent advancements demonstrate its efficacy across
various fields, utilizing causal graphs and structural equations. In
this paper, we use the Granger algorithm for causal analysis since
it can accurately determine the causal relationship between time
series through statistical tests. Granger’s core principle is that 𝑋𝑡
causes 𝑌𝑡
if past values of time series 𝑋 significantly improve the
prediction of the current value of time series 𝑌𝑡
. Granger causality
test is designed to detect such causality (𝑋𝑡 → 𝑌𝑡
). We only consider causal relationships between service-metric pairs within the
time window 𝑇𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑙 after the anomaly is detected. And we use the
List𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 ’s highest-ranked nodes to first expend.

, 𝑦𝑡 ∈ [0,𝑇𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑙]. Then, we construct two linear regression
models to predict 𝑦𝑡 using past observations and apply ordinary
least squares to estimate the model parameters with the time series
data 𝑥𝑡 and 𝑦𝑡
. The difference between these two models is that the
full model carries additional information from service-metric pair
(𝑣𝑖

As a result, statistical calculation proves that the value:
𝐹 =
(𝑆𝑆𝐸part − 𝑆𝑆𝐸full)/(𝑑full − 𝑑part)
𝑆𝑆𝐸full/(𝑇𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑙 − 𝑑full − 1)
, (4)
𝑆𝑆𝐸part and 𝑆𝑆𝐸full represent the error sum of squares from the
above models. 𝑑full, 𝑑part are the degrees of freedom of the models, which are 𝜏, 2𝜏. We can estimate the probability of the null
hypothesis from the F distribution, and if the probability is below
the significance level 𝛾, it indicates that there is Granger causality
from 𝑥𝑡 to 𝑦𝑡
. In other words, the service-metric pair (𝑣𝑖
,𝑚𝑥 ) →
(𝑣𝑗
,𝑚𝑦).
4.4.2 Learning Termination Strategy via Q-learning. After the first
round of filtering in the anomaly detection phase, it is still complicated to establish the causal graph. For example, there are still 𝑎
services, and each service has 𝑏 metrics. Then there will be 𝑎 × 𝑏
nodes in the causal graph. Too complex causal graphs will also affect
subsequent processing. Manually constructing pruning models is
time-consuming and ineffective. Moreover, artificially constructed

pruning models may have poor generalization performance. It is
not suitable for systems with high complexity and continuous
changes that require frequent modifications. To overcome the above
problems, we propose an automatic termination strategy with Qlearning. This strategy can balance the time-consuming efficiency
and accuracy. Once trained, this policy is capable of being deployed
on fresh incidents autonomously, without the need for human intervention. Figure 5 shows the overflow of extensions to the causal
graph. Before each expansion, we will select the action with the
maximum Q-value for expansion, and after the expansion, we will
update the Q-table globally. The Bellman function is as follows:

Markov Decision Process (MDP) [17]: When expanding causal
graphs, at any given moment, the impact of actions on the environment is only related to the current state and is independent of
previous states. In this paper, we use MDP which consists of three
main elements: states, actions, and rewards. At each time step t,
given a current state st, the best action is selected based on the value
of the Q-table. The action is to expand two nodes to the current
node. Update the Q-table according to the reward r received by the
action until the entire list is traversed. The different components of
the MDP are defined as follows:
• State 𝑠𝑡 ∈ S contains the number of nodes, edges, layers, and
services of the current causal graph.
• Action Action space 𝐴 = {𝑎0, 𝑎1...., 𝑎𝑖
, ..., 𝑎𝑚, 𝑎𝑚+1}, where 𝑚
represents the number of services in the initial ranking list. The
first𝑚 actions 𝑎𝑖 represent the expansion of the 𝑖 −𝑡ℎ node when
operating the current node. In particular, when a node has been
expanded, all actions containing it will be unavailable. The last
action is to end expansion. When the model determines that
the current causal graph can meet the accuracy requirements of
RCA, it should stop expansion to improve efficiency.
• Reward Function The reward function contains two components, one is the complexity of the graph, and the other is the
accuracy of RCA. This can take into account the accuracy and
efficiency of RCA. The reward function is shown in Equation 6.

rca measures the accuracy of the RCA based on the
pruned trace structure. The value of 𝜎 decreases as 𝑘 assumes
the values of 1, 3, and 5, in that order.
Incorporating reinforcement learning into the construction of
causal graphs allows for a dynamic analysis termination mechanism. This approach improves the speed of RCA while ensuring
sufficient accuracy. It permits the expansion of the causal graph to
stop promptly when it reaches the relatively optimal state. Instead
of stopping after traversing the ranking list, thereby avoiding time
wastage due to over-extension.
4.4.3 Prune Strategy. Each point in this causal graph respectively
stands for one service-metric pair. After obtaining the causal graph,
we can perform pruning by analyzing the relationships between
nodes. In a causal graph involving time relationships, the cause
event must occur before the effect event. Therefore, based on the

cause-and-effect diagram, we can determine the chronological order
in which abnormal events occurred. The root service causing the
exception usually has no parent node, meaning it does not depend
on other nodes. Thus, we can identify the root service that may
cause the anomaly by removing the nodes with parents in the causeand-effect graph, leaving only the root node and orphan nodes.
Ultimately, we can get the List𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 = {(X𝑖
, Y𝑎), (X𝑗
, Y𝑏
), ...}.
Through this process, we can further update and refine the initially obtained abnormal service rankings, transitioning from preliminary service-level results to specific metric-level results. This
method enhances the accuracy of system anomaly detection and
the efficiency of troubleshooting, providing better assistance to
SREs in resolving subsequent anomalies.
5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
In this secion, we aim to evaluate our method to answer the following research questions (RQs):
• RQ1: How much does anomaly detection benefit from
multi-modal data?
• RQ2: How does MRCA perform at the metric-level and
service-level?
• RQ3: How much do the different data sources and pruning
module contribute to RCA?
• RQ4: Can the pruning module of MRCA reduce the time cost of
RCA?
5.1 Experimental Setup
Experimental data.The public data set provided by Nezha is used.
This data set is collected on OnlineBoutique (OB) and TrainTicket
(TT). TrainTicket is a platform that provides railway ticketing services through which users can easily inquire, book, and pay for
train tickets. Similarly, OnlineBoutique is a microservice system
focused on e-commerce. These two systems have been widely used
in many previous studies and have become important experimental
platforms for researchers to study microservice architecture and
performance. There are three categories of anomalies injected into
the system: CPU contention anomalies [45], network congestion
anomalies [25, 27], and code defect anomalies [28, 48]. The dataset
composition is shown in Table 2, and the ratio of training to test
set is 60% and 40%.
Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate the performance of the model,
we selected two widely used metrics to measure its performance in
various aspects [32]:
(1) Since anomaly detection is a binary classification task, we
use Precision, Recall, and F1-Score (denoted as F1) to evaluate the
performance of models:
𝐹 1 =
2 × 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 × 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 (9)
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =
𝑇 𝑃
𝑇 𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃
(10)
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =
𝑇 𝑃
𝑇 𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁
(11)
In the above equations, TN is the number of normal samples
that are correctly classified. FN represents the number of missed
anomalies. FP stands for the number of normal samples triggering
alarms.
(2) Precision@K (PR@K): PR@K evaluates the top K RCA results
for any matches to the injected anomaly. The higher the PR@K,
the more accurate the RCA results are, which means the better the
algorithm performance, defined as:
𝑃𝑅@𝐾 =
1
|𝐴|
∑︁
𝑎∈𝐴
Í
𝑖<𝐾 𝑅𝑎 (𝑖) ∈ 𝑉𝑎
min(𝐾, |𝑣𝑎 |) (12)
𝑃𝑅@𝐾 is the precision of top 𝐾 results. In this formulation, |𝐴|
represents the collection of all anomaly cases. 𝑅𝑎 (𝑖) represents the
rank of the case 𝑎. 𝑅𝑎 (𝑖) ∈ 𝑉𝑎:If the result ranked at 𝑖 is a true root
cause, then the value is 1, otherwise, it is 0. 𝑣𝑟𝑐 is a collection of
root causes.
(3) Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): By averaging the reciprocal of
the rank of the correct answer for each query, a metric is obtained
that measures the model’s ability to correctly locate the cause of
an anomaly. This indicator pays special attention to the ranking of
the first correct answer and is an effective indicator to evaluate the
system’s ability to give the correct root cause at top1:
𝑀𝑅𝑅 =
1
|𝐴|
∑︁
|𝐴|
𝑖=1
1
𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖
(13)
𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖 represents the ranking position of the correct answer
returned by the system in the 𝑖-th query.
Baseline. To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency, we compare
our method with the following baselines.
• CloudRanger[42]: It proposes a dynamic causal analysis method
that does not rely on preset topology to quickly identify problem
services in cloud services. This system can be quickly deployed
on a variety of cloud-native systems without requiring prior
knowledge.
• MicroCause [32]: It combines the path conditional time series
algorithm and the time causality-oriented random walk method,
effectively integrating the sequential relationship of the time
series and the causal relationship of the monitoring data.
• TraceDiag[9]: It uses reinforcement learning to formulate pruning strategies for service dependency graphs to improve the
efficiency of RCA. This strategy has strong interpretability and
generalization performance.

Implementation and Settings. We implement the prototype of
our method built on Python 3.10. All experiments are conducted on
a Mac server with an Intel Xeon Gold 5318Y 2.10GHz CPU, 256 GB
RAM, and 1TB SSD Disk. The hyperparameters of the experiment
include the sliding window length, sliding step size, and manually
adjusted thresholds. Specifically, we set the sliding window length
to 20 to adequately capture the relationships between timestamps
in the time series. The sliding step size is set to 5, and thresholds
are selected based on reconstruction errors from the training set.
The VAE model is trained with a batch size of 64 for 1000 epochs,
using a learning rate of 10−3
, and a regularization weight of 10−5
to prevent overfitting.
5.2 Experimental Results
5.2.1 RQ1. How much does anomaly detection benefit from multimodal data?
Ground truths are determined based on the operations known
to involve fault injections. Once the fault is injected, data within
the observation time window are regarded as abnormal data; the
remaining data is treated as normal data. Table 3 presents the performance comparison of the anomaly detection processes in different
RCA approaches. We can draw the following conclusions:
(1) MRCA significantly outperforms other methods in terms of
F1 score, Precision, and Recall, indicating that it has fewer missed
anomalies and false alerts. A more accurate anomaly detection process aids subsequent cause location. If the anomaly is not detected
correctly, subsequent steps will not be performed, greatly affecting the accuracy of RCA. Likewise, reducing false alarms avoids
wasting system resources and ensures the efficiency of the analysis
process.
(2) Generally, multi-modal data methods perform better than
single-modal data methods in the anomaly detection process. As
shown in Table 1, when only using a single data source such as
traces, some types of anomalies may be missed. MRCA combines log
and trace, which can complement each other and cover abnormal
situations more comprehensively.
(3) In addition, MRCA also uses VAE as an anomaly detection
model, which is a deep learning model. By learning and generating
data through a probabilistic model, its regularized latent space helps
capture the core features of the data. This benefits the generalization
ability and recognition capability of a new kind of fault. We can also
choose advanced deep-learning models in further work to improve
model performance.
In summary, MRCA is greatly improvement at detecting anomalies and improving 𝐹 1 score by 56.4% ∼ 115.7%. The high accuracy
of anomaly detection is helpful in reducing the noise in the inputs
for subsequent cause location steps.
5.2.2 RQ2. How does MRCA perform at the metric-level and
service-level?
To demonstrate our method’s effectiveness in fault localization,
we compare its accuracy with baselines, visually highlighting its
advantages. Besides, our research compares the accuracy of data sets
collected from two different platforms, providing a comprehensive
perspective and data support for our analysis. Table 4 and Table 5
present the comparison between SOTA methods in service-level and
metric-level, respectively, underpinning the following conclusions:
First, we evaluate the accuracy of MRCA at the service-level.
As the Table 4 shows, MRCA achieves 𝑃𝑅@1 of 60.1%, 𝑃𝑅@3 of
81.3%, 𝑃𝑅@5 of 88.2%, 𝑀𝑅𝑅 of 71.3%, and improve 𝑃𝑅@1 by 74.72%
∼ 367.67% on average at service-level. Since code errors generally
don’t reflect in metrics, we only measured the accuracy of identifying the resource anomalies at metric-level. And MRCA achieves
𝑃𝑅@1 of 71.9%, 𝑃𝑅@3 of 85.4%, 𝑃𝑅@5 of 90.3% and improves 𝑃𝑅@1
by 23.8% ∼ 73.8% compared to baselines on average at metric-level.
The above results demonstrate the superior accuracy and effectiveness of MRCA in localizing anomalies compared to other methods.
Nezha’s accuracy is lower than reported in its original paper because this paper calculates the accuracy across all samples, while its
original paper reports the accuracy based on conditional probability.
By logically leveraging multi-modal data, MRCA enables a more
comprehensive understanding of the system’s status, thereby allowing for more accurate root cause localization. Relying solely on
trace or metric data for RCA has significant limitations. Trace-based
approaches lack the granularity needed to capture subtle performance anomalies, while metric-based methods miss the detailed
contextual information provided by traces, leading to incomplete
or inaccurate diagnoses. Besides, MRCA obtains the initial ranking of abnormal services during the anomaly detection stage and

5.2.3 RQ3. How much do the different data sources and pruning
module contribute to RCA?
Data sources Ablation In this part, we conducted a series of
ablation experiments to explore the contribution of different data
sources and pruning module to the results:
• MRCA w/o L: Drops logs while inputs traces and KPIs by
removing the log modeling module.
• MRCA w/o T: Drops latency extracted from traces by removing
the trace modeling module
• MRCA w/o A: Drop attention mechanism from the model.
• MRCA w/ A in T: Shift attention from the log to the trace.
The ablation study results are shown in Table 6, and we focus
on root cause location which is our major task. All data modalities
work together to achieve the highest efficiency of MRCA, but their
contributions are not exactly the same.
Table 6: Experimental results of the ablation study.
Variants OnlineBoutique TrainTicket
PR@1 PR@5 PR@1 PR@5
MRCA 0.589 0.875 0.622 0.889
MRCA w/o L 0.482 0.768 0.533 0.733
MRCA w/o T 0.554 0.857 0.600 0.822
MRCA w/o A 0.534 0.839 0.578 0.800
MRCA w/ A in T 0.518 0.803 0.556 0.756
In particular, traces contribute the least, since MRCA w/o T is the
second best. Meanwhile, logs contribute the most, because dropping
them from the data has a major impact on accuracy. A significant
portion of the anomalies we inject into the two benchmark systems
are related to the code area. These code faults are correlated with
changes in log frequency rather than trace latency.
In addition, we explored the contribution of the attention mechanism. Experimental results show that the attention mechanism
improves the accuracy of the results. However, it is less effective
on traces compared to logs. Therefore, MRCA focuses the attention
mechanism on logs during the anomaly detection phase. MRCA w/
A in T actually leads to worse performance than MRCA w/o T,
further demonstrating the importance of log in the data collected
by two benchmarks. When deploying MRCA on other datasets or
platforms, the attention mechanism can be reasonably adjusted
based on the frequency of different types of anomalies.
In conclusion, the involved data sources and model all contribute
to the effectiveness of MRCA. Different data contribute to varying
degrees, which emphasizes the importance of properly modeling
multi-modal data.
Parameter Sensitivity The termination strategy is a key to the
accuracy and efficiency of root cause localization. We evaluate the
effect of the termination strategy by analyzing how the accuracy
and time of root cause localization change with the hyperparameters. In Section 4.4.2, we configured two parameters, 𝛼 and 𝛽, in
the reward function of the Q-learning algorithm. The 𝛼 and 𝛽 respectively represent the complexity of the causal graph and the
accuracy of the RCA.

To the end, we set different 𝛼/𝛽, and measure the accuracy and
time. We choose the 𝑃𝑅@1 and 𝑃𝑅@5 as the indicator of accuracy.
The results of the evaluation are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen
that both the accuracy and time decrease with the increase of the
𝛼/𝛽, as the analysis process is terminated earlier and fewer services
are reached and considered. However, within a specific range of parameter settings, accuracy remains relatively constant while there
is a sharp decline in time, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the
strategy. In order to balance accuracy and time, the best 𝛼/𝛽 is 0.05
for availability issues.
5.2.4 RQ4. Can the pruning module of MRCA reduce the time
cost of RCA?
To answer this question, we compare the average time to locate
a single anomaly between the baselines and MRCA on two benchmarks. The result is shown in Figure 6. We can find that the time cost
of RCA on platform TrainTicket is generally higher than that on
the platform OnlineBoutique.Since TrainTicket offers a wider range
of services and features, it leads to more complex data and consequently higher processing times. MRCA can terminate the causal
analysis process in time. In RCA, the relatively time-consuming
part is the causal analysis process. Although we have introduced
a pruning module that adds some time overhead, the overall time
savings significantly outweigh this additional cost. Therefore, the
MRCA required will be greatly reduced, as can be observed from
the result. For these two benchmarks, the difference in our time
consumption is not very large, which proves the stability of MRCA
and its great potential to be expanded to large systems.

6 RELATED WORK
In today’s data-intensive system environment, the data that the system can collect is becoming increasingly rich and diverse. Therefore,
how to reasonably utilize the multidimensional data recorded by
these systems to perform RCA has become a key area of research. In
view of this, it is particularly important to accurately process multidimensional data and screen out indicators that are closely related
to the root cause of the problem. Rajeev Gupta et al. [15] proposed
a problem-determination platform with multi-dimensional knowledge integration. There are also some studies [22, 39, 49] using
machine learning or deep learning methods to process multi-modal
data. The above methods are explorations of utilizing multi-modal
data, but they do not fully utilize the effective information in multimodal data.
The collection of metrics contains the time dimension, thus revealing the sequence. This feature makes adding time series relationships the key to determining the direction of causality and
identifying potential confounding variables. In addition, time series
analysis can be used to explore nonlinear causal relationships and
further improve the accuracy of results. Zheng et al. [53] used contrastive learning to extract features in time series to implement the
RCA algorithm. Yuan et al. proposed an improved PC algorithm to
capture the sequential relationship of time series data [32]. In the
field of causal analysis, researchers have implemented much more
efficient algorithms [33, 56]. This allows us to use more advanced
causal analysis algorithms to optimize the speed and accuracy of
our algorithms.
By locating the root cause at the metric level, SREs can more accurately pinpoint the problem. This avoids a misunderstanding of the
problem and leads to more targeted solutions. Additionally, it helps
the team objectively assess the extent of the problem. The existing
RCA algorithms [30, 31, 43, 57] positioned at the metric-level are
too complex in constructing casual graphs. Making them unsuitable
for quickly locating root causes in large systems. Our algorithm
will use methods such as pruning to obtain simpler results.
7 DISCUSSION
7.1 Limitations
MRCA is a data-driven model specifically designed for the scope
of reliability management. Therefore, it is inherently limited to
detecting and locating anomalies that manifest within observable
data. Consequently, MRCA is unable to identify and pinpoint issues
that do not leave an imprint in the data it analyzes, such as external
attacks or internal disruptions. Additionally, for faults like code
errors which generally do not cause significant changes in metric,
we can only localize them at the service-level instead of metric-level.
Moreover, MRCA is applicable to anomalies that can be reflected
in the multi-modal data we utilize. However, some systems cannot fully collect these multi-modal data. Although our approach
allows for the lack of some data modalities, it is best to provide all
data types to maximize the model effect. With the development of
microservice systems, there are now many integrated tools that
can be loaded into the system to easily monitor and obtain these
multi-modal data.
In addition, MRCA employs representative metrics to determine
the type of anomalies. However, more complex anomalies might
manifest across multiple metrics, or anomalies in a specific metric
could be caused by various types of anomalies. Therefore, future
work could involve exploring the pattern matching between anomaly types and metrics to achieve more accurate results and enhance
the generalizability of our model. In about 50% of fail cases, services with low activity which provide less normal data, making it
challenging to detect anomalies using MRCA. Specifically, in 40%
of fail cases, code errors that cause network timeouts, evident only

in the call chain, are not addressed by MRCA due to the lack of
exploitation of service dependencies for code errors.
7.2 Threats to Validity
(1) Internal threat: The primary internal threat is the validity of
the baseline implementation, which is based on our understanding
due to the lack of publicly available code for except Nezha. Our
reproduction may not fully capture specific implementations detailed in the original works. To mitigate this potential threat, we
have carefully reviewed and followed the original papers associated
with the baselines. (2) External threat: The external threat is the
generalizability of our experimental results. We only evaluate our
method on the Nezha dataset, which is a simulated dataset with a
limited number of injected anomalies. This limitation can be alleviated by Nezha’s injection of typical resource and code anomalies
that are common in industrial systems. Besides, a single service
request in Nezha includes over 600 events, comparable to industrial
microservice systems where a request involving dozens of service
calls typically generates hundreds of log events. Thus, the amount
of events is comparable.
8 CONCLUSION
In this work, we identified three significant limitations of existing
RCA methods: (1) reliance on single-modality data, which misses
complex interrelationships, resulting in suboptimal solutions; (2)
service-level RCA lacks sufficient detail, and metric-level RCA is
slow due to the complexity of causal analysis; and (3) separation
of detection and localization stages, along with reliance on inaccurate techniques, hampers accurate RCA. To address these challenges, we introduced MRCA, a fine-grained and highly efficient
RCA approach designed for microservices utilizing multi-modal
data. MRCA integrates features from traces and logs into VAE to
generate an initial anomaly ranking. This ranking guides the expansion of a causal graph, with reinforcement learning dynamically
terminating the expansion process, ultimately achieving detailed
metric-level root cause identification. Our extensive experiments
on the OnlineBoutique and TrainTicket platforms demonstrated
MRCA’s effectiveness, showing high accuracy in both anomaly
detection and root cause analysis, significantly outperforming stateof-the-art methods. Ablation experiments further confirmed the
contributions of different data sources, highlighting MRCA’s high
generalization and stability in large-scale microservice systems.
Overall, MRCA provides a robust solution for rapid and accurate
RCA, addressing critical limitations of current methodologies and
enhancing the reliability and efficiency of microservice systems.
